- Run both versions against the same database (not simultaneously)

## 💉 Source Code

This bot is licensed under **AGPL-3.0**. Source code available at:

**https://github.com/blubskye/himiko-c**

*"I'll always be transparent with you~ That's true love, right?"*

## 🩸 License

This project is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)** 💉

### 💉 What This Means For You~

*"I want to share everything with you... let's be open with each other~"*

The AGPL-3.0 is a **copyleft license** that ensures this software remains free and open. Here's what you need to know:

#### ✅ You CAN:
- 💉 **Use** this bot for any purpose (personal, commercial, whatever~)
- 🔪 **Modify** the code to your heart's content
- 📤 **Distribute** copies to others
- 🌐 **Run** it as a network service (like a public Discord bot)

#### 📋 You MUST:
- 📖 **Keep it open source** - ANY modifications you make must be released under AGPL-3.0
- 🔗 **Publish your source code** - Your modified source code must be made publicly available
- 📝 **State changes** - Document what you've modified from the original
- 💌 **Include license** - Keep the LICENSE file and copyright notices intact

#### 🌐 The Network Clause (This is the important part!):
*"Even if we're apart... I'll always find you~"*

Unlike regular GPL, **AGPL has a network provision**. This means:
- If you modify this code **at all**, you must make your source public
- Running a modified version as a network service (like a Discord bot) requires source disclosure
- This applies whether you "distribute" the code or not - network use counts!
- The `/source` command in this bot helps satisfy this requirement!

#### ❌ You CANNOT:
- 🚫 Make it closed source or keep modifications private
- 🚫 Remove the license or copyright notices
- 🚫 Use a different license for modified versions
- 🚫 Run modified code without publishing your source

#### 💡 In Simple Terms:
> *"If you use my code to create something, you must share it with everyone too~ That's true love, right?"*

This ensures that improvements to the bot benefit the entire community, not just one person.
